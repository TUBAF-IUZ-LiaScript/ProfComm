# Meeting 03.02.

## Discussion
1. What criteria do we want to use to reflect on our presentation? (e.g. average word length)
* Language
    * Spelling
    * Grammar
    * Appropriate vocabulary
* Structure (see models below)
    * Beginning, body, end
    * Evaluation of how your presentation went (sorted/weighted, positive/negative)
    * Storytelling
* Content
    * Content accurate
    * Self-reflection applicable
    * Conclusion
    * Number of words (not too many, not too few) -> 1 Page? 500-1000 words?
* Rhetoric
    * Ethos (credibility, perception, details, writing style, honesty)
    * Pathos (connection, understandable why you did what you did, empathy, honesty, professional but not too businesslike)
    * Logos (cognitive, logical, write about YOUR presentation)
* Miscellaneous
